# Probability-Distributions

# Data Analysis with Probability Distributions and Visualizations

## Project Overview
In this project, I utilized the "performance" dataset parsed in earlier assignments to perform data analysis and generate insightful visualizations. The focus was on understanding the distribution of variables and identifying patterns through visualization.

## Key Tasks

### Task A: Empirical Probability Distribution
- Generated a histogram to visualize an empirical probability distribution using relevant data from the dataset.
- The visualization highlights the frequency of specific values, providing insights into the distribution's functional form (e.g., average, variance).

### Task B: Custom Visualization
- Created a second visualization (e.g., scatter plot, time series, or geographical map) to analyze trends and relationships within the data.
- This second plot offers a deeper understanding of the dataset's underlying patterns.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations like histograms and scatter plots.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Key Visualizations
1. **Histogram**: Empirical probability distribution of a selected variable.
2. **Scatter Plot/Time Series**: An additional visualization for variable comparison.

## Code and Implementation
The implementation includes:
1. Code for parsing and analyzing the dataset.
2. Visualizations created using Matplotlib.
3. Descriptive analysis of the functional form of the distributions.

### Visualizations Preview
Below are sample visualizations from the project:
1. **Empirical Probability Distribution**
   - A histogram showing the distribution of variable X.
2. **Scatter Plot/Time Series**
   - Visualization showing the relationship between variable Y and Z.
